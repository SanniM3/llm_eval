{"doc_id": "doc_001", "title": "Introduction to Machine Learning", "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.", "source": "AI Textbook", "metadata": {"category": "technology"}}
{"doc_id": "doc_002", "title": "Deep Learning Fundamentals", "text": "Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These networks are called deep because they have many layers of neurons. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Common architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images and transformers for text.", "source": "AI Textbook", "metadata": {"category": "technology"}}
{"doc_id": "doc_003", "title": "Natural Language Processing Overview", "text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. Key tasks include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and question answering. Modern NLP relies heavily on transformer-based models like BERT and GPT.", "source": "NLP Guide", "metadata": {"category": "technology"}}
{"doc_id": "doc_004", "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "text": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based and generative approaches. In RAG systems, a retriever first finds relevant documents from a knowledge base, then a generator produces an answer based on both the query and retrieved documents. This approach helps reduce hallucinations and keeps responses grounded in factual information.", "source": "RAG Paper", "metadata": {"category": "technology"}}
{"doc_id": "doc_005", "title": "LLM Evaluation Methods", "text": "Evaluating large language models requires multiple metrics. Accuracy-based metrics like exact match and F1 score measure correctness. Semantic similarity metrics compare meaning using embeddings. Faithfulness metrics assess whether outputs are grounded in provided context. Robustness evaluation tests stability under input perturbations.", "source": "Eval Guide", "metadata": {"category": "methodology"}}
